# Web App Manifest

Web App Manifest is a new standard feature of the Web Platform, which
allows applications to provide some metadata to help browsers know how
to install the application to the device's home screen.

The example app we created with Angular CLI in the [previous guide](./cli-setup.md)
already contains a Web App Manifest. Feel free to edit it; the file will be
automatically moved over as Angular CLI builds the app.

`src/manifest.webapp:`

```json
{
  "name": "Hello Mobile",
  "short_name": "Hello Mobile",
  "icons": [
    {
			"src": "/android-chrome-36x36.png",
			"sizes": "36x36",
			"type": "image/png",
			"density": 0.75
		},
		{
			"src": "/android-chrome-48x48.png",
			"sizes": "48x48",
			"type": "image/png",
			"density": 1
		},
		{
			"src": "/android-chrome-72x72.png",
			"sizes": "72x72",
			"type": "image/png",
			"density": 1.5
		},
		{
			"src": "/android-chrome-96x96.png",
			"sizes": "96x96",
			"type": "image/png",
			"density": 2
		},
		{
			"src": "/android-chrome-144x144.png",
			"sizes": "144x144",
			"type": "image/png",
			"density": 3
		},
		{
			"src": "/android-chrome-192x192.png",
			"sizes": "192x192",
			"type": "image/png",
			"density": 4
		}
  ],
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#e0e0e0",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "portrait"
}
```

## Customization

All of the required icons are also present in the project automatically. Though,
it's the Angular logo, and you'll probably want to update it with your own.

You'll also want to make sure the `short_name` property **12 characters** or less so
it will fit nicely under the app icon on the home screen, without being truncated.

Tip: Use [http://realfavicongenerator.net/](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) to easily
create correctly-sized icons from your app's logo.

Since this file is already referenced by `src/index.html`, there's no additional
work needed to help browsers know how to install your app.

`src/index.html`

```
...
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webapp">
...
```

## How To Install the App

Browsers support installation in various ways. In **Chrome on Android**,
an app can be installed by selecting "Add to Home Screen" from the
menu. Chrome on Android also will automatically prompt a user to install
an app to home screen if the user meets certain usage criteria<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

**Opera on Android** allows users to install apps by clicking a "+" icon in the browser url
bar, and will also prompt users to install the app, using the same criteria
as Chrome<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

**Firefox on Android** has support for adding to home screen, and will use icons and short_name
from the Web App Manifest. Work is planned to support banner prompts<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>.

**Safari on iOS** doesn't yet support Web App Manifest, but does allow for proprietary meta tags to
be added to a page to let users add it to the home screen with proper icons, title, and display
mode<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>. It's up to the user to install the app to home screen from the
browser menu. The app generated by Angular CLI automatically includes the correct
icons and meta tags to allow installing to home screen on Safari.
